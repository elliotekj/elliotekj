### Hi, I'm Elliot ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a product designer turned software developer keen on building, problem solving, performance and databases. My interest in recent years has been in the Swift and Rust ecosystems. I still mostly write Swift professionally (and would love the opportunity to write Rust professionally), but I also believe the wonderful Elixir has a very bright future and am focussing a lot on that at the moment too.

I currently freelance but am interested in joining a team full-time writing Rust and/or Elixir. If your team is hiring, please get in touch!
